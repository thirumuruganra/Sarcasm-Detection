# Sarcasm Detection in Tamil and Malayalam

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to detect sarcasm in Tamil and Malayalam texts using machine learning models. The dataset includes both original texts and their English translations to compare performance with and without translation. Various feature extraction techniques (TF-IDF, Word2Vec) and classification models are evaluated.

## 📊 Model Performance
The results show how different models perform with translated and non-translated texts. The best-performing models are:
- **SVM and Logistic Regression (TF-IDF)**: Highest accuracy without translation.
- **Meta Stacking (TF-IDF)**: Best overall performance.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
  - NLTK (Text Preprocessing)
  - Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)
  - Matplotlib (Visualization)
