# Sarcasm Detection in Tamil and Malayalam

## üìå Overview
This project aims to detect sarcasm in Tamil and Malayalam texts using machine learning models. The dataset includes the original texts in Tamil and Malayalam. Various feature extraction techniques (TF-IDF, Word2Vec) and classification models are evaluated. 
This was done as a part of a Shared Task on "Sarcasm Identification of Dravidian Languages" organised by DravidianCodeMix@2024

## üìä Model Performance and Result
The results show how different models perform with translated and non-translated texts. The best-performing models are:
- **Ensemble Model (TF-IDF)**: Best performance for Malayalam (without Translation).
- **Meta Stacking (TF-IDF)**: Best performance for Tamil (without Translation).
